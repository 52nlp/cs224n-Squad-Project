      "['other researchers point out that finding a difference in disease prevalence between two socially defined groups does not necessarily imply genetic causation of the difference . they suggest that medical practices should maintain their focus on the individual rather than an individual \\'s membership to any group . they argue that overemphasizing genetic contributions to health disparities carries various risks such as reinforcing stereotypes , promoting racism or ignoring the contribution of non-genetic factors to health disparities . international epidemiological data show that living conditions rather than race make the biggest difference in health outcomes even for diseases that have \" race-specific \" treatments . some studies have found that patients are reluctant to accept racial categorization in medical practice .\\n', 'chivalry and the ethos of courtly love developed in royal and noble courts . this culture was expressed in the vernacular languages rather than latin , and comprised poems , stories , legends , and popular songs spread by troubadours , or wandering minstrels . often the stories were written down in the chansons de geste , or \" songs of great deeds \" , such as the song of roland or the song of hildebrand . secular and religious histories were also produced . geoffrey of monmouth ( d. c. 1155 ) composed his historia regum britanniae , a collection of stories and legends about arthur . other works were more clearly history , such as otto von freising \\'s ( d. 1158 ) gesta friderici imperatoris detailing the deeds of emperor frederick barbarossa , or william of malmesbury \\'s ( d. c. 1143 ) gesta regum on the kings of england .\\n', \"at the time of the roman empire , about two thousand years ago , various tribes , which spoke celtic dialects of the insular celtic group , were inhabiting the islands . the romans expanded their civilisation to control southern great britain but were impeded in advancing any further , building hadrian 's wall to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 ad . at that time , ireland was populated by a people known as hiberni , the northern third or so of great britain by a people known as picts and the southern two thirds by britons .\\n\"]\n"
